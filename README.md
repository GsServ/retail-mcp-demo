# Multi-Channel Programming for Retail Sales

This repository demonstrates a modern approach to implementing Multi-Channel Programming (MCP) for retail businesses. The system unifies inventory, product, customer, and sales data across different sales channels including physical stores, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, and social media sales platforms.

## Key Features

- Centralized inventory management across all sales channels
- Unified customer profiles and purchase history
- Channel-specific pricing and promotions
- Consistent brand experience across all touchpoints
- Real-time sales and inventory analytics
- Order fulfillment optimization

## Project Structure

- `/api`: Backend REST API service that all channels communicate with
- `/web`: Web e-commerce storefront
- `/mobile`: Mobile app codebase (iOS and Android)
- `/pos`: Point of Sale system for physical retail locations
- `/social`: Social media store integrations
- `/marketplace`: Third-party marketplace integrations (Amazon, eBay, etc.)
- `/admin`: Administrative dashboard for managing all channels
- `/shared`: Shared components, utilities, and types
- `/docs`: Documentation for the system
